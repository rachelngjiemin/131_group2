    "1. (4 points) Build your first dataframe including at least on target variable and a set of features.  In a markdown cell, clearly explain what the target variable is, what each row represents, and what the features are.  Provide a summary of the entries in the dataframe (e.g. using a few plots and `pd.describe`)\n",
    "2. (4 points) Choose and justify a type of prediction model to train.  (E.g. lasso, or random forests.)\n",
    "4. (4 points) Generate a test-train split.  Then cross validate the model with the training data to tune at least one hyperparameter.\n",
    "3. (4 points) Evaluate how well the prediction model performs on test data. \n",
    "5. (4 points) For clarity.  Use markdown cells to clearly and concisely explain what you are doing and your justification for your decisions.  Keep your code clean and readable and well commented.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We are looking for progress and not perfection. In each category we'll score 1 point for completion, 2 points for demonstrating some understanding, 3 points for just a few mistakes, 4 points for demonstrating mastery.\n",
